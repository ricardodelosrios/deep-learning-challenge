## Introduction

In an effort to optimize its impact on society, the non-profit Alphabet Soup Foundation seeks to develop a tool that allows it to identify funding applicants with the highest probability of success in their charitable projects.

The project focuses on predicting the success of charitable organizations, from pre-processing the data to creating and training a neural network model. In order to improve Alphabet Soup's decision making and its ability to generate a positive impact on society.

## Libraries

The project utilizes several libraries and tools, including:

`keras-tuner`: it is a powerful library used for hyperparameter tuning, specifically designed to optimize neural network models. It helps in the systematic exploration of various hyperparameter configurations to find the most effective settings for a given neural network architecture.

`scikit-learn`: It is a versatile machine learning library that provides a wide range of tools for various aspects of the machine learning workflow. In this project, it is primarily used for data preprocessing, dataset splitting, and standardization.

`pandas`: It is a popular library for data manipulation and analysis. In this project, Pandas is used for handling the dataset, including reading data from an online source, cleaning, transforming, and preparing it for training.

`tensorflow`: It  is an open-source deep learning library developed by Google. In this project, TensorFlow is used for creating, building, and training deep neural network models.
